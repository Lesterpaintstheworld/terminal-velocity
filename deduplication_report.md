# Deduplication Report for Terminal Velocity Project

## Deduplication Process Steps

1. **Content Duplication Detection**: Begin by scanning the narrative files to identify semantically similar content and partial overlaps. This will involve assessing thematic relevance and contextual overlap among the files.

2. **Pre-Consolidation Checks**: Before merging any identified duplicates, perform validation checks to ensure that all relevant information from the files is captured and that the narrative structure remains intact.

3. **Execute Safe Merges**: Once validation is complete, proceed to merge the identified duplicate files using the Aider interface, ensuring that the context and meaning of each segment are preserved.

## 2. Detect Partial Overlaps
- **Analyze for Repeated Phrases**: Look for files that may contain repeated phrases or segments, particularly in character development, interaction scripts, and scene descriptions.

## 3. Document Findings
- **Create a Report**: Compile a report detailing identified duplicates and overlaps, categorizing them by type (e.g., character profiles, scene descriptions) for consolidation in the next phase.

## Initial Findings
- **Character Profiles**: Multiple files exist for characters such as Isabella Torres and Marcus Reynolds, which may have overlapping content in their profiles and development arcs.
- **Scene Descriptions**: Numerous scene files across different acts may contain similar narrative elements or dialogues.
- **Interaction Scripts**: Multiple interaction scripts for characters could have redundant content.

## Next Steps
1. **Perform Content Analysis**: Begin scanning the identified sections for semantic similarities and repeated phrases.
2. **Compile Data**: Document the findings in a structured format for review and consolidation.
