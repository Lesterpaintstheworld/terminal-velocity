# Deduplication Report for Terminal Velocity Project

## Deduplication Process Overview
### Objective
To initiate the deduplication process effectively, I will begin with the following steps:

1. **Content Duplication Detection**: I will scan the narrative files to identify semantically similar content. This will involve analyzing the files for any thematic relevance and contextual overlap that suggests duplication.

2. **Detecting Partial Overlaps**: In conjunction with the first step, I will assess the file structures for any partial duplications, focusing on repeated phrases or similar narrative arcs that may need consolidation.

3. **Pre-Consolidation Checks**: Before proceeding with any merging, I will perform checks to confirm that all relevant information is captured and that the narrative structure is not disrupted by potential consolidation.

## 2. Detect Partial Overlaps
- **Analyze for Repeated Phrases**: Look for files that may contain repeated phrases or segments, particularly in character development, interaction scripts, and scene descriptions.

## 3. Document Findings
- **Create a Report**: Compile a report detailing identified duplicates and overlaps, categorizing them by type (e.g., character profiles, scene descriptions) for consolidation in the next phase.

### Next Steps
- I will begin scanning the files for duplication and partial overlaps, documenting findings for further analysis. Once duplicates are identified, I will prepare for safe consolidation, ensuring that the narrative integrity is maintained throughout the process.
- **Character Profiles**: Multiple files exist for characters such as Isabella Torres and Marcus Reynolds, which may have overlapping content in their profiles and development arcs.
- **Scene Descriptions**: Numerous scene files across different acts may contain similar narrative elements or dialogues.
- **Interaction Scripts**: Multiple interaction scripts for characters could have redundant content.

## Next Steps
1. **Perform Content Analysis**: Begin scanning the identified sections for semantic similarities and repeated phrases.
2. **Compile Data**: Document the findings in a structured format for review and consolidation.
