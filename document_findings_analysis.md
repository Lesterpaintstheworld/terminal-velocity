# Document Findings Analysis for Terminal Velocity Narrative

## Semantic Mapping and Redundancy Analysis

### 1. Conduct Semantic Mapping
- **Objective**: Identify and document instances of redundant semantic content across narrative files.
- **Action**: Begin by scanning key files related to the narrative structure, character development, and thematic elements. Focus on identifying duplications in:
  - **Character Profiles**: Look for overlapping character traits, backgrounds, and development arcs.
  - **Story Elements**: Analyze chapters and scenes for repeated themes or plot points.
  - **World-Building Documents**: Examine economic frameworks and societal structures for redundancy.

### 2. Cross-System Analysis
- **Objective**: Track the flow of information across files to identify clusters of related information and conceptual matches.
- **Action**: 
  - Utilize the project structure to map out connections between files. For example, link character profiles with their respective scenes and interactions.
  - Identify clusters where similar themes or character arcs are discussed across different documents.

### 3. Document Findings
- **Objective**: Create a structured record of all identified redundancies.
- **Action**: 
  - Use this document to log all instances of redundancy, including the context in which they appear.
  - Categorize findings by type (e.g., character, plot, world-building) for easier reference during consolidation.

### Next Steps
- **Initiate the Semantic Mapping**: Start with the character profiles and story outlines, as these are likely to contain significant overlaps.
- **Schedule Regular Updates**: Document findings in real-time to maintain an accurate log of redundancies as they are identified.

By following these steps, we will ensure a thorough analysis of the narrative files, paving the way for effective consolidation and improved clarity in the storytelling.
