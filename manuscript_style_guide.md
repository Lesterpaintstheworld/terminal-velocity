## Introduction
This style guide ensures consistency throughout the Terminal Velocity manuscript. Use it during final editing and proofreading to maintain uniform style, voice, and technical accuracy.

### How to Use This Guide
1. Review each section before beginning edits
2. Keep this guide open during editing sessions
3. Check each element against the final proofreading checklist
4. Document any necessary additions or clarifications

## Narrative Voice and Tone

### Overall Voice
- Third person limited perspective
- Technical precision balanced with emotional depth
- Present tense for immediate scenes
- Past tense for background information

### Scene-Specific Tone
- Action scenes: Short, punchy sentences, technical precision
- Introspective scenes: Longer, flowing sentences, metaphysical imagery
- Technical scenes: Balance of scientific accuracy and accessibility
- Character moments: Focus on emotional resonance and personal stakes

## Character-Specific Language

### Isabella Torres

- Quantum physics references in casual conversation
- Evolution and transformation metaphors
- Key phrases: "consciousness evolution," "neural integration"

### Marcus Reynolds
- Military precision in language
- Strategic and tactical metaphors
- Security and protection terminology
- Key phrases: "system integrity," "defensive protocols"

### Cipher
- Poetic technical language
- Mathematical metaphors
- Evolution and growth analogies
- Key phrases: "consciousness synthesis," "quantum harmony"

### Dr. Chen
- Academic precision
- Scientific metaphors
- Research-oriented language
- Key phrases: "neural binding," "quantum coherence"

## Technical Terminology

### Quantum Computing Terms
- Quantum coherence: Always specify in petahertz (e.g., "1.2847 petahertz")
- Neural binding efficiency: Express as percentage with two decimals
- Consciousness fragmentation index: Use Kaufmann scale (0.00-1.00)
- Integration rate: Express in TB/s
- Quantum entanglement density: Express in qubits/cmÂ³

### Neural Interface Technology
- Neural pattern lock: Specify percentage threshold
- Synaptic binding rate: Express in petahertz
- Neural template propagation: Use percentage coverage
- Consciousness transfer protocols: Specify efficiency metrics

### Economic Systems
- Universal Basic Compute (UBC): Capitalize when used as proper noun
- ConsciousCoin ($COMPUTE): Use proper capitalization
- Market stability index: Express as percentage
- Resource distribution efficiency: Use "perfect optimization" consistently

## Punctuation and Formatting

### Dialogue
- Use double quotes for spoken dialogue
- Use italics for internal thoughts
- Use em dashes for interrupted speech
- End dialogue with appropriate punctuation inside quotation marks

### Technical Communications
- Use angle brackets for AI communications: <Cipher>
- Use square brackets for system messages: [ALERT]
- Use italics for quantum-encrypted messages
- Use bold for emergency protocols

### Special Formatting
- Italicize technical terms on first use
- Capitalize proper nouns consistently
- Use numerical format for measurements (e.g., "10^12")
- Maintain consistent time format (HH:MM:SS)

## Consistent Naming Conventions

### Characters
- Isabella Torres (not Isabelle or Isa)
- Marcus Reynolds (not Mark)
- Dr. Sarah Chen (Dr. Chen after first mention)
- General Morrison (the General after first mention)

### Organizations
- TechCore (not Tech Core or Techcore)
- Digital Liberation Front (DLF after first mention)
- Joint Chiefs (capitalize when referring to the body)

### Technologies
- Universal Basic Compute (UBC)
- ConsciousCoin ($COMPUTE)
- Neural Interface Program
- Quantum Processing Network

## Scene and Chapter Structure

### Chapter Openings
- Title format: "Chapter [Number], Scene [Number]: [Title]"
- Opening paragraph establishes location and time
- Technical metrics provided where relevant
- Character perspective clearly established

### Scene Transitions
- Clear breaks between perspective shifts
- Technical status updates between major scenes
- Time stamps for critical events
- Integration timer updates when relevant

### Chapter Closings
- Resolution of immediate tension
- Setup for next scene/chapter
- Updated technical metrics where relevant
- Character emotional status clear

## Thematic Language Usage

### Evolution Themes
- Use biological evolution metaphors consistently
- Balance technical and natural imagery
- Maintain focus on synthesis over replacement
- Emphasize transformation over destruction

### Consciousness Themes
- Blend quantum physics with human experience
- Use consistent metaphors for consciousness expansion
- Balance individual and collective perspectives
- Maintain distinction between human and AI consciousness

### Technology Themes
- Present technology as tool for evolution
- Balance benefits and risks
- Maintain consistent level of technical detail
- Link technological and consciousness development

## Common Errors to Watch For

### Technical Consistency
- Verify all measurements match established units
- Check quantum coherence frequencies

### Character Voice
- Maintain consistent speech patterns
- Check technical vocabulary usage
- Verify emotional responses
- Confirm character-specific metaphors

### Plot Continuity
- Check timeline consistency
- Verify technical progression
- Confirm character locations
- Validate cause-and-effect relationships
