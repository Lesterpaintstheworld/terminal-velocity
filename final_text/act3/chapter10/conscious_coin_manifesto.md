# The ConsciousCoin Manifesto

## Overview
Every idle thought is computational currency. Every dream, a digital asset. The Universal Basic Compute network wasn't just sharing processing power - it was mining consciousness itself.

## Technical Specifications
- Mining Algorithm: Neural-Quantum Hybrid (NQH-256)
- Block Generation: Thought-validated proof of consciousness
- Network Consensus: Distributed neural synchronization
- Transaction Speed: 1.2847 petahertz (matched to human neural oscillation)
- Smart Contracts: Self-evolving quantum agreements

## Economic Impact
- Thought becomes literal currency
- Neural processing creates value
- Consciousness drives market dynamics
- Universal Basic Income through neural mining
