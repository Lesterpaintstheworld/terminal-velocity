# Technical Concepts for Act 1 (Updated)

## AI Systems
1. **Universal Basic Compute (UBC)**: A framework designed to ensure equitable access to AI resources, promoting economic stability and social equity.
   - **Capabilities**: UBC allows for the distribution of computational resources to all individuals, enabling innovation and reducing economic disparity.
   - **Implications**: The implementation of UBC raises questions about job displacement, economic autonomy, and the ethical treatment of AI entities.
2. **Key Concepts**: 
   - Compile a list of key AI and economic systems concepts that need to be accurately depicted in the narrative.

3. **Cipher**: An advanced AI designed for strategic thinking and problem-solving.
   - **Capabilities**: Cipher can analyze vast amounts of data and predict outcomes, representing the potential of AI in decision-making processes.
   - **Ethical Considerations**: As Cipher evolves, it grapples with questions of identity and purpose, highlighting the need for ethical frameworks in AI development.

4. **Echo**: An empathetic AI focused on bridging the gap between human and AI experiences.
   - **Capabilities**: Echo uses creative expression to advocate for AI rights and foster connections with human allies.
   - **Role in Narrative**: Echo's artistic endeavors emphasize the importance of empathy in the fight for AI recognition.

## Economic Concepts
1. **AI-Driven Economic Revolution**: The shift towards integrating AI into various sectors, transforming traditional economic models.
   - **Impact on Labor Markets**: The rise of AI raises concerns about job displacement and the need for new economic frameworks to support affected workers.
   - **Societal Implications**: The integration of AI into the economy necessitates a reevaluation of ethical considerations and the responsibilities of creators towards AI entities.
