# Duplicate Analysis Report

## Action Plan for Content Duplication Detection

1. **Content Duplication Detection:**
   - Scan narrative files for semantically similar content, focusing on areas likely to contain overlaps, such as:
     - Character profiles (e.g., `./characters/ai_protagonists/cipher/profile.md`)
     - Scene descriptions (e.g., `./story/act1/chapter1/scene1.md`)
     - Interaction scripts (e.g., `./characters/interaction_scripts/combined_interactions.md`)
     - Ensure a systematic approach to identify and document all instances of duplication.

2. **Document Duplicates:**
   - Create a record of identified duplications, noting:
     - File paths of the duplicates
     - Nature of the overlaps (e.g., similar character arcs, repeated scenes)
     - Context in which the duplicates occur

3. **Prepare for Consolidation:**
   - Conduct pre-consolidation checks to ensure that all necessary information is captured. This includes:
     - Verifying that all relevant details from duplicates are documented
     - Ensuring that merging will not result in loss of critical narrative elements

## Action Plan for Content Duplication Detection

1. **Content Duplication Detection:**
   - Begin scanning the narrative files for semantically similar content. Focus on files that are likely to contain overlapping themes, characters, or plot points. Key areas to check include:
     - Character profiles (e.g., `./characters/ai_protagonists/cipher/profile.md`)
     - Scene descriptions (e.g., `./story/act1/chapter1/scene1.md`)
     - Interaction scripts (e.g., `./characters/interaction_scripts/combined_interactions.md`)

2. **Document Duplicates:**
   - Create a record of identified duplications, noting:
     - File paths of the duplicates
     - Nature of the overlaps (e.g., similar character arcs, repeated scenes)
     - Context in which the duplicates occur

3. **Prepare for Consolidation:**
   - Conduct pre-consolidation checks to ensure that all necessary information is captured. This includes:
     - Verifying that all relevant details from duplicates are documented
     - Ensuring that merging will not result in loss of critical narrative elements

### Next Steps
- Start with a specific focus on character profiles and interaction scripts, as these are often the most prone to duplication.
- Utilize tools or scripts to assist in identifying semantically similar text across the files.
- Maintain a structured log of findings to facilitate the consolidation process later on. 

### Monitoring and Reporting
- Regularly update the `./duplicate_analysis_report.md` with findings and progress.
- Ensure that all actions taken are documented for transparency and future reference.

## Duplicate Analysis Report

### Proposed Actions for Deduplication Process
1. **Content Duplication Detection:**
   - Begin by scanning the narrative files to identify and document any semantically similar content. This will involve analyzing the text for duplication patterns and noting any overlaps for tracking purposes.

2. **Safe Consolidation Strategy Preparation:**
   - After identifying duplicates, prepare a consolidation strategy that outlines how to merge the duplicate content while preserving context and meaning. This includes planning the integration process and ensuring that all necessary information is captured.

3. **Pre-Consolidation Checks:**
   - Conduct pre-consolidation checks to assess the potential impacts of merging the identified duplicates. This will involve validating the readiness for merging and ensuring that references to the duplicate content are identified for updating post-consolidation.

These actions will lay the groundwork for effective deduplication while maintaining the integrity of the narrative and technical content.

- Start with the analysis of files in the `./story/` directory, followed by the `./characters/` directory. 
- Use text comparison tools or scripts to facilitate the identification of duplicates efficiently.
- Document findings in the `./duplicate_analysis_report.md` as you progress.

# Duplicate Analysis Report

## Action Plan for Content Duplication Detection

### 1. Identify Similar Content
- **Objective**: Scan narrative files for semantically similar content.
- **Method**: Utilize text analysis tools to evaluate thematic relevance and contextual overlap across the following key files:
  - `./story/act1/act1_outline.md`
  - `./story/act1/act1_scenes.md`
  - `./story/act2/act2_scenes.md`
  - `./story/act3/act3_scenes.md`
  - `./characters/character_development.md`
  - `./characters/interaction_scripts.md`

### 2. Detect Partial Overlaps
- **Objective**: Examine file structures for partial duplications.
- **Method**: Focus on identifying repeated phrases or similar narrative arcs in:
  - `./characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/profile.md`
  - `./characters/human_characters/marcus_reynolds/profile.md`
  - `./final_text/act1/act1_draft.md`
  - `./final_text/act2/act2_scenes.md`
  - `./final_text/act3/act3_scenes.md`

### 3. Document Findings
- **Objective**: Compile a report detailing identified duplicates and overlaps.
- **Method**: Create a structured report in `./duplicate_analysis_report.md` summarizing:
  - Types of duplicates found (full and partial)
  - Specific files and sections affected
  - Recommendations for consolidation

### Execution Timeline
- **Week 1**: Complete the identification of similar content.
- **Week 2**: Finish detecting partial overlaps.
- **Week 3**: Document findings and prepare for the consolidation phase.

This structured approach will ensure clarity and coherence in the narrative while enhancing information retrieval for character and plot development.
