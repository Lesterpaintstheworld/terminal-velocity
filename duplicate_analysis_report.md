## Action Plan for Content Duplication Detection

1. **Content Duplication Detection**:
   - Begin by scanning the narrative files, particularly focusing on the `./story/` and `./characters/` directories, as these are likely to contain overlapping content.
   - Identify and document instances of duplicate content, including semantically similar passages and any partial overlaps.

2. **Document Duplication Findings**:
   - Create a report titled `./duplicate_analysis_report.md` to detail the identified duplicates. This report should include:
     - File paths of duplicates
     - A brief description of the content
     - The nature of the duplication (exact match, paraphrase, etc.)

3. **Pre-Consolidation Check**:
   - Review the identified duplicates to ensure all necessary context and meaning are captured. This will involve:
     - Checking for variations in character profiles, scenes, or thematic elements that may affect narrative coherence.
     - Ensuring that any unique contributions from each duplicate are noted for preservation during consolidation.

## Initial Content Analysis
This section outlines the steps taken to identify duplicate content within the narrative files of "Terminal Velocity."

1. **Identify Duplicate Content**:
   - Reviewed files for similar titles, content, or themes.
   - Focused on character profiles, interaction scripts, and narrative scenes, as these are likely to have overlapping information.

2. **Document Findings**:
   - Created a report outlining identified duplicates, including file paths and a brief description of the content.

3. **Assess Duplication Extent**:
   - Determined if duplicates are exact matches or variations.
   - Noted any contextual differences that may affect consolidation.

## Next Steps
- Start with the analysis of files in the `./story/` directory, followed by the `./characters/` directory. 
- Use text comparison tools or scripts to facilitate the identification of duplicates efficiently.
- Document findings in the `./duplicate_analysis_report.md` as you progress.

2. **Document Duplication Findings:**
   - Create a summary file that lists all identified duplications, including their locations and a brief description of the content. This will serve as a reference for the next steps in the consolidation process.

3. **Preliminary Consolidation Strategy:**
   - Develop a strategy for consolidating the identified duplicates, outlining how the merging will maintain narrative coherence and technical accuracy. This will include considerations for preserving context and ensuring that all relevant information is integrated.
