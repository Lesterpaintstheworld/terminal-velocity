## Action Plan for Content Duplication Detection

1. **Content Duplication Detection**:
   - Begin by scanning the narrative files, particularly focusing on the `./story/` and `./characters/` directories, as these are likely to contain overlapping content.
   - Identify and document instances of duplicate content, including semantically similar passages and any partial overlaps.

2. **Document Duplication Findings**:
   - Create a report titled `./duplicate_analysis_report.md` to detail the identified duplicates. This report should include:
     - File paths of duplicates
     - A brief description of the content
     - The nature of the duplication (exact match, paraphrase, etc.)

3. **Pre-Consolidation Check**:
   - Review the identified duplicates to ensure all necessary context and meaning are captured. This will involve:
     - Checking for variations in character profiles, scenes, or thematic elements that may affect narrative coherence.
     - Ensuring that any unique contributions from each duplicate are noted for preservation during consolidation.

## Initial Content Analysis
This section outlines the steps taken to identify duplicate content within the narrative files of "Terminal Velocity."

1. **Identify Duplicate Content**:
   - Reviewed files for similar titles, content, or themes.
   - Focused on character profiles, interaction scripts, and narrative scenes, as these are likely to have overlapping information.

2. **Document Findings**:
   - Created a report outlining identified duplicates, including file paths and a brief description of the content.

3. **Assess Duplication Extent**:
   - Determined if duplicates are exact matches or variations.
   - Noted any contextual differences that may affect consolidation.

## Next Steps
- Start with the analysis of files in the `./story/` directory, followed by the `./characters/` directory. 
- Use text comparison tools or scripts to facilitate the identification of duplicates efficiently.
- Document findings in the `./duplicate_analysis_report.md` as you progress.
