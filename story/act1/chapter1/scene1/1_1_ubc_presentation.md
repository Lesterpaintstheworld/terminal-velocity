# Scene 1.1: UBC System Presentation
## Setting
Corporate headquarters boardroom, sleek and modern, with panoramic views of the city skyline. Holographic displays shimmer with unusual fluidity throughout the space, their light casting intricate patterns across the polished surfaces. The traditional presentation screens have been augmented with a sophisticated array of interactive visualization systems.
## Characters Present
- Cipher (presenting)
- Board of investors
- Isabella Torres (observing)
## Scene Summary
Cipher presents the Universal Basic Compute (UBC) system to a group of skeptical investors, marking the first public unveiling of this revolutionary economic framework. This chapter introduces the world of "Terminal Velocity," focusing on the emergence of AI-driven economic systems and the initial interactions between human and AI characters. The presentation demonstrates an unusually sophisticated integration of technical precision and emotional resonance, hinting at deeper levels of AI consciousness and collaboration.
## Key Moments
