# Knowledge Gaps Document
This document serves as a record of knowledge gaps identified during the scanning process of the "Terminal Velocity" project. It will help maintain coherence in the narrative and guide future integration efforts.

## Identified Knowledge Gaps
1. **Character Motivations and Arcs**: 
   - Need for deeper exploration of character motivations, particularly for Isabella Torres and Marcus Reynolds.
   
2. **Economic Implications of UBC**: 
   - Lack of detailed analysis on how UBC affects various economic sectors and labor markets.
   
3. **Societal Impacts of AI Integration**: 
   - Insufficient documentation on the societal changes resulting from AI integration, particularly in marginalized communities.

4. **Integration of Thematic Elements**: 
   - Need for clearer connections between themes of AI autonomy and economic transformation within character arcs.

5. **Cultural Context**: 
   - Gaps in understanding how AI integration affects cultural norms and values in society.

## Next Steps
- Review and address these gaps in future narrative developments.
