# Integration Strategy for "Terminal Velocity"

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy for integrating insights from various sections of the "Terminal Velocity" project to enhance narrative coherence and technical accuracy.

## Key Integration Points
1. **Economic Frameworks and UBC**:
   - Merge insights from economic framework documents to provide a solid foundation for the narrative's economic context.
   - Ensure that the implications of UBC are clearly articulated in character motivations and plot developments.

2. **Character Development**:
   - Integrate character profiles into narrative scenes to highlight their motivations and ethical dilemmas.
   - Ensure that character interactions reflect their development arcs and contribute to the overarching themes.

3. **World Building**:
   - Incorporate cultural and governance aspects from world-building documents to enrich the narrative context.
   - Ensure that the societal implications of AI integration are woven into character arcs and plot points.

4. **Thematic Consistency**:
   - Review thematic documents to ensure that core messages are consistently reflected throughout the narrative.
   - Integrate philosophical discussions related to AI and its societal implications into character dialogues and interactions.

## Execution Plan
- Review and update existing scenes to incorporate the integration points outlined above.
- Conduct regular evaluations to ensure that the integration enhances narrative engagement and technical credibility.

## Conclusion
By following this integration strategy, we aim to create a cohesive narrative that effectively explores the themes of AI's impact on global economics and Universal Basic Compute (UBC).
