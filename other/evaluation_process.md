# Objective
To initiate the evaluation process for the "Terminal Velocity - Novel Mission," I will proceed with the following steps:
1. **Conduct a Comprehensive Review**: I will start by reviewing the current content of the project files, focusing on the specifications and style guide to establish baseline quality metrics. This will involve identifying key claims and elements that need verification.
2. **Document Initial Findings**: I will create an initial evaluation report that outlines the findings from the review, highlighting areas of concern, unsupported claims, and suggestions for improvement.
3. **Signal Quality Issues**: I will annotate the relevant sections of the project files to indicate quality issues and areas that require further verification or enhancement, ensuring that these annotations are clear and actionable.

1. **Conduct Initial Content Verification**: I will review the existing narrative to ensure that the technical aspects related to AI and economic systems are accurate and align with real-world research.
2. **Document Findings**: I will create a record of any discrepancies or unsupported claims identified during the initial verification. This documentation will serve as the foundation for further evaluations and feedback.
3. **Prepare for Feedback Loop**: Based on the findings, I will outline actionable feedback to address any issues discovered during the verification process. This will set the stage for a more comprehensive quality review later.

These steps will be executed within the constraints of three operations. Let's proceed with the first operation.

1. **Conduct Initial Content Verification**: I will review the existing narrative to ensure that the technical aspects related to AI and economic systems are accurate and align with real-world research. This will involve checking specific claims made in the text against reliable sources.

2. **Document Findings**: I will create a record of any discrepancies or unsupported claims identified during the initial verification. This documentation will serve as the foundation for further evaluations and feedback.

3. **Prepare for Feedback Loop**: Based on the findings, I will outline actionable feedback to address any issues discovered during the verification process. This will set the stage for a more comprehensive quality review later.

These steps will be executed within the constraints of three operations. Let's proceed with the first operation.

# Required Files
### Initial Content Verification Process

To begin the evaluation process for "Terminal Velocity - Novel Mission," I will focus on verifying the technical accuracy of AI and economic systems as presented in the narrative. Here are the steps I will take:

1. **Identify Key Claims**: I will extract specific claims related to AI and economic systems from the narrative. This will include references to AI capabilities, economic frameworks, and their implications on society.

2. **Cross-Reference with Reliable Sources**: For each identified claim, I will consult relevant documents and research materials within the project structure to ensure accuracy. This includes:
   - **Research Documents**: Such as `./research/economic/economic_models.md` and `./research/technical/ai_systems.md`.
   - **World-Building Frameworks**: Like `./world_building/economic/framework/economic_systems.md` and `./world_building/technical/context/technological_context.md`.

3. **Document Findings**: Any discrepancies or unsupported claims will be noted for further review. This will help in creating a comprehensive evaluation report.

### Next Steps

I will now proceed to identify and extract key claims related to AI and economic systems from the narrative. This will involve reviewing the following files:

- `./final_text/technical_accuracy_check.md`
- `./final_text/act1/act1_draft.md`
- `./story/act1/act1_foundation.md`

Once I have identified the claims, I will cross-reference them with the relevant research and world-building documents. Let's begin this process.
