# UBC Deployment Monitoring Documentation

## Objective
1. **Monitor File Changes:** Set up monitoring of designated project files to capture significant developments related to the Universal Basic Compute (UBC) system and its impact on AI autonomy and economic transformations.
2. **Identify Key Events:** Analyze the captured file changes to identify key events that reflect the evolution of AI and economic shifts, focusing on human and AI interactions, conflicts, and resolutions.
3. **Document Findings:** Create structured chronicles based on the identified key events, ensuring clarity and coherence while aligning with the mission's themes of economic autonomy and human-AI relationships.
