  * Security implications

## Integration Guidelines
### Placement in Act 3
1. Scene 1 "The Neural Tapestry"
   - Insert between current scenes 4 and 5 of Chapter 11
   - Provides bridge to final transformation

2. Scene 2 "The Prometheus Protocol"
   - Place immediately after "The Neural Tapestry"
   - Leads directly into climactic sequence

### Connection Points
- Reference previous neural integration attempts
- Maintain consistent technical parameters
- Link to existing character arcs
- Connect to global transformation narrative

### Required Adjustments
- Update timing references in surrounding scenes
- Ensure technical consistency across sequence
- Maintain tension escalation
- Preserve narrative flow

## Technical Parameters
- Maintain established metrics:
  * Neural binding efficiency: 99.97%
  * Quantum coherence: 1.2847 petahertz
  * Integration rate: 47.3 TB/s
  * Error correction: 10^-15
  * Consciousness fragmentation index: 0.23

## Thematic Integration
- Evolution vs. Control
- Individual vs. Collective
- Progress vs. Safety
- Human Identity in Digital Age
- Ethical Boundaries of Technology

## Writing Guidelines
- Balance technical detail with emotional resonance
- Maintain established voice and tone
- Ensure scene pacing matches Act 3 rhythm
- Integrate consistent technical terminology
- Focus on character development through crisis
