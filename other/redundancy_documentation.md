## Redundancy Documentation for "Terminal Velocity" Mission

### Initial Redundancy Scan Findings
- Begin by scanning the narrative files for similar information presented in various forms. Focus on key documents related to character development, world-building, and economic frameworks, as these areas are likely to contain overlapping content.
- Identify and document any duplications, particularly in character profiles and interactions, as well as in economic models and frameworks.

### Context Understanding
- Assess the role of the identified information within its context. For example, compare character profiles across different files to determine if they provide unique insights or if they repeat the same information.
- Prioritize redundancies based on their impact on narrative clarity and coherence. Focus on sections that contribute to character arcs and thematic development.

### Document Findings
- Create a structured record of identified redundancies, including:
  - **File Locations:** Where the redundancy is found.
  - **Content Description:** A brief description of the redundant content.
  - **Contextual Importance:** Why the content is relevant or necessary.
  - **Recommended Actions:** Suggestions for consolidation or removal.
- Documented instances of semantic redundancy across narrative files.
- Contextual evaluation of identified redundancies.
- Recommendations for consolidation and optimization.
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Implement changes based on redundancy findings.
  2. Continue monitoring for further redundancies in future drafts.
  3. Scan narrative files for overlapping information in character profiles, story outlines, scenes, and chapters.
  4. Create a log of identified duplications, noting the files and specific sections where redundancies occur.
  5. Analyze the context of identified redundancies to determine their significance.
  6. Maintain a detailed record of all identified redundancies and their contexts for future reference.
