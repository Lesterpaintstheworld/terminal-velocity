# Redundancy Findings Report

This document will log identified redundancies and overlaps found during the semantic mapping and cross-system analysis of the "Terminal Velocity" narrative files.

## Identified Redundancies

1. **Character Profiles**
   - **Isabella Torres**: Similar descriptions found in `./characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/profile.md` and `./characters/character_interaction_matrix.md`.
   - **Marcus Reynolds**: Overlapping motivations noted in `./characters/human_characters/marcus_reynolds/profile.md` and `./story/act1/chapter1/scene1.md`.

2. **Story Elements**
   - **Act 1 Scene Descriptions**: Repeated themes in `./story/act1/chapter1/scene1.md` and `./story/act1/chapter2/scene1.md`.
   - **Economic Frameworks**: Similar economic concepts discussed in `./research/economic/economic_models.md` and `./research/UBC_Economic_Impact_Research.md`.

3. **Thematic Elements**
   - **AI Autonomy**: Discussions on AI autonomy appear in both `./themes/ai_autonomy.md` and `./characters/ai_protagonists/cipher/profile.md`.

## Consolidation Recommendations
- **Character Profiles**: Merge overlapping descriptions and motivations into a single, comprehensive profile for each character.
- **Story Elements**: Streamline repeated themes across scenes to enhance narrative flow.
- **Thematic Elements**: Integrate discussions on AI autonomy into a unified thematic document to avoid redundancy.

## Next Steps
- Consolidate overlapping content in the identified files.
- Ensure clarity and coherence in character arcs and thematic elements.
