# Universal Basic Compute Documentation
## Objective and Societal Impact
- This documentation aims to thoroughly explain the UBC system's functionality, structure, and implications in the world of "Terminal Velocity." It highlights the societal impact of UBC, particularly in promoting AI autonomy and equitable resource distribution, and includes references to the following documents:
- **Universal Basic Compute (UBC)** dans `research/technical/ubc_framework.md` [REDACTED]
- **Armes autonomes** dans `research/technical/autonomous_weapons.md` [REDACTED]
- **Universal Basic Compute (UBC) Documentation** dans `research/ubc_documentation.md` [REDACTED]
- **UBC Framework** dans `research/technical/ubc_framework.md` [REDACTED]
### Comprehensive Coverage
- **Functionality**: Detail how UBC operates, including user access, resource allocation, and maintenance.
- **Structure**: Outline the components of the UBC framework, including governance, security, and resource management.
- **Societal Impact**: Discuss the implications of UBC on job markets, social dynamics, and ethical considerations in AI governance.

## Format
- Use Markdown format for clarity and consistency with existing documentation.
- Ensure adherence to the standard documentation guidelines as outlined in "demande/" for cross-referencing and versioning.
## Implementation Steps
1. Create a New File:
   - Create a new Markdown file named `ubc_documentation.md` in the `team_world/documentation/` directory.
2. Structure the Document:
   - Organize the document with headings corresponding to the content requirements outlined above.
3. Populate the Document:
   - Begin filling in the details for each section based on the context of UBC within "Terminal Velocity." Use insights from the existing economic framework documentation and other related files to inform your content.
4. Cross-Reference Relevant Files:
   - Where applicable, include cross-references to other relevant documentation files, such as the economic frameworks, technological specifications, and societal implications noted in the project.
