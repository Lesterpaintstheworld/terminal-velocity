# Redundancy Documentation for "Terminal Velocity" Mission

## Initial Redundancy Scan Findings
- Documented instances of semantic redundancy across narrative files.
- Contextual evaluation of identified redundancies.
- Recommendations for consolidation and optimization.
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Implement changes based on redundancy findings.
  2. Continue monitoring for further redundancies in future drafts.
  3. Scan narrative files for overlapping information in character profiles, story outlines, scenes, and chapters.
  4. Create a log of identified duplications, noting the files and specific sections where redundancies occur.
  5. Analyze the context of identified redundancies to determine their significance.
  6. Maintain a detailed record of all identified redundancies and their contexts for future reference.

## Next Steps
- Implement changes based on redundancy findings.
- Continue monitoring for further redundancies in future drafts.
