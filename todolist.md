# Terminal Velocity - Writing Priorities

## IMMEDIATE FOCUS: Technical Consistency
Current: ~42,000/50,000 words (84%)
Need: +8,000 words to reach target

### Priority 1: Standardization
- Unify AI consciousness marker descriptions across all scenes
  * Align with specifications in research/technical/ai_consciousness_markers.md
  * Standardize Type-A, B, C pattern descriptions
  * Ensure consistent quantum computing parameters
  * Maintain coherent evolution markers

### Priority 2: Scene Completion
1. Chapter 4, Scene 2 (needs +800 words focusing on economic implications)
2. Chapter 5, Scene 2 (requires +1,200 words on security protocols)
3. Chapter 5, Scene 3 (needs revision for technical consistency)

### Priority 3: Character Development
- Isabella Torres
  * Strengthen emotional stakes in Chapter 4-5 transitions
  * Deepen relationship dynamics with Marcus
  * Enhance technical expertise demonstrations
- Marcus Reynolds
  * Develop security concerns more fully
  * Balance skepticism with growing understanding
  * Strengthen character arc through Chapter 5

### Priority 4: Technical Integration
- [ ] Standardize UBC framework descriptions
- [ ] Align quantum computing specifications
- [ ] Unify economic pattern descriptions
- [ ] Verify consciousness evolution markers

## Weekly Target
Complete technical consistency review and expand key scenes
(~3,000 new words/week)

## Next Steps
1. Begin standardization of technical descriptions
2. Complete Chapter 4-5 transitions
3. Strengthen character arcs
4. Maintain quantum computing accuracy
