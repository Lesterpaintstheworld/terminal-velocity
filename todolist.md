## IMMEDIATE FOCUS: Act 1 Completion
Current: ~35,000/50,000 words (70%)
Need: +15,000 words to reach target

### Priority 1: Current Tasks
ACTIVE: Expanding Chapter 3 scenes
Target: Complete remaining Act 1 scenes to 3,300 words each
- Technical Integration
  * Strengthen UBC framework technical details in all scenes
  * Enhance quantum computing array descriptions
  * Maintain consistency in AI consciousness emergence patterns
  * Verify economic pattern accuracy
- Character Development
  * Deepen Isabella's analytical observations
  * Expand Marcus's security concerns
  * Build tension through competing AI perspectives
  * Add emotional resonance to technical concepts
- Environmental Detail
  * Enhance computation center atmosphere
  * Add sensory details to bunker scenes
  * Build scene tension through environment
  * Use setting to reinforce themes

### Priority 2: Next Expansion Targets
1. Chapter 3, Scene 1 (needs technical consistency review)
2. Chapter 4, Scene 2 (requires expansion of AI consciousness markers)
3. Chapter 5, Scene 1 (Nova's perspective needs development)

### Priority 3: Review Tasks
- Verify technical accuracy of UBC framework descriptions
- Ensure consistent portrayal of AI consciousness markers
- Validate economic system logic across scenes
- Review quantum computing specifications accuracy

### Priority 4: Balance Chapter Lengths
- [ ] Chapter 3 (~2,800 words) needs +7,200 words
- [ ] Chapter 4 (~2,900 words) needs +7,100 words
- [ ] Chapter 5 (~3,100 words) needs +6,900 words

## Writing Guidelines
- Maintain consistent technical terminology
- Develop character arcs through scene expansions
- Balance technical/emotional elements
- Build toward Act 1 climax

## Weekly Target
Complete at least 2 scene expansions per week
(~5,000 new words/week)

## Next Steps
1. Begin expansion of Chapter 3, Scene 1
2. Review expanded scenes for technical consistency
3. Update chapter transitions
4. Maintain UBC framework accuracy
