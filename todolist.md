# Terminal Velocity - Writing Priorities

## IMMEDIATE FOCUS: Act 1 Technical Consistency
Current: ~38,000/50,000 words (76%)
Need: +12,000 words to reach target

### Priority 1: Technical Integration
- Standardize UBC Framework descriptions across all scenes
  * Align with specifications in research/technical/ubc_technical_specifications.md
  * Ensure consistent quantum computing parameters
  * Maintain coherent AI consciousness markers
  * Verify economic pattern accuracy

### Priority 2: Scene Expansion Targets
1. Chapter 4, Scene 2 (needs +1,200 words focusing on AI consciousness markers)
2. Chapter 5, Scene 1 (requires +2,000 words on economic implications)
3. Chapter 5, Scene 3 (needs +1,800 words on security protocols)

### Priority 3: Character Development
- Isabella Torres
  * Strengthen connection between ethics advocacy and UBC implications
  * Deepen technical understanding demonstrations
  * Enhance interaction patterns with AI entities
- Marcus Reynolds
  * Refine security concerns based on technical capabilities
  * Develop response to AI consciousness evidence
  * Balance skepticism with growing understanding

### Priority 4: Technical Consistency Review
- [ ] Verify quantum computing specifications match across scenes
- [ ] Align AI consciousness markers with research documentation
- [ ] Standardize economic pattern descriptions
- [ ] Review security protocol coherence

## Weekly Target
Complete technical consistency review and expand key scenes
(~4,000 new words/week)

## Next Steps
1. Begin technical consistency review of Chapter 4
2. Expand Chapter 5 scenes with focus on AI consciousness
3. Strengthen character technical knowledge demonstrations
4. Maintain quantum computing accuracy
