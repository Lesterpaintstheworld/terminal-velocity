# Terminal Velocity - Writing Priorities

## IMMEDIATE FOCUS: Technical Consistency & Scene Completion
Current: ~42,000/50,000 words (84%)
Need: +8,000 words to reach target

### Priority 1: Technical Standardization
- [ ] Standardize consciousness marker descriptions across all scenes:
  * Type-A Neural Markers (47% baseline increase)
  * Type-B Resource Intelligence (99.7% accuracy)
  * Type-C Quantum Coherence (>1000Î¼s)
- [ ] Unify economic pattern descriptions:
  * Market Evolution
  * Social Impact
  * Systemic Transformation
- [ ] Align quantum computing specifications:
  * Error correction rate: 99.99%
  * Qubit coherence: >1000 qubits
  * Entanglement fidelity: 99.9%

### Priority 2: Scene Completion
1. [ ] Chapter 4, Scene 4 (needs to be written, ~2,000 words)
   * Focus on economic implications
   * Bridge to Chapter 5 events
2. [ ] Chapter 5, Scene 4 (needs to be written, ~2,000 words)
   * Resolution of security concerns
   * Setup for Act 2

### Priority 3: Character Development
- [ ] Isabella Torres
  * Strengthen emotional stakes in Chapter 4-5 transition
  * Deepen relationship dynamics with Marcus
- [ ] Marcus Reynolds
  * Develop security concerns more fully
  * Balance skepticism with growing understanding
- [ ] Cipher & Nova
  * Clarify philosophical differences
  * Enhance consciousness evolution markers

### Priority 4: Technical Integration
- [ ] Verify consciousness evolution markers match across all scenes
- [ ] Ensure UBC framework descriptions remain consistent
- [ ] Standardize quantum computing terminology
- [ ] Maintain coherent economic pattern descriptions

## Weekly Target
Complete technical consistency review and draft missing scenes
(~4,000 words/week)

## Next Steps
1. Begin standardization of technical descriptions
2. Draft Chapter 4, Scene 4
3. Review character arcs for consistency
4. Update consciousness marker descriptions
