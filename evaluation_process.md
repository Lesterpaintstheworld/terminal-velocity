# Objective
To initiate the evaluation process for the "Terminal Velocity - Novel Mission," I will proceed with the following steps:

1. **Conduct Initial Content Verification**: I will review the existing narrative to ensure that the technical aspects related to AI and economic systems are accurate and align with real-world research.
2. **Document Findings**: I will create a record of any discrepancies or unsupported claims identified during the initial verification. This documentation will serve as the foundation for further evaluations and feedback.
3. **Prepare for Feedback Loop**: Based on the findings, I will outline actionable feedback to address any issues discovered during the verification process. This will set the stage for a more comprehensive quality review later.

These steps will be executed within the constraints of three operations. Let's proceed with the first operation.

1. **Conduct Initial Content Verification**: I will review the existing narrative to ensure that the technical aspects related to AI and economic systems are accurate and align with real-world research. This will involve checking specific claims made in the text against reliable sources.

2. **Document Findings**: I will create a record of any discrepancies or unsupported claims identified during the initial verification. This documentation will serve as the foundation for further evaluations and feedback.

3. **Prepare for Feedback Loop**: Based on the findings, I will outline actionable feedback to address any issues discovered during the verification process. This will set the stage for a more comprehensive quality review later.

These steps will be executed within the constraints of three operations. Let's proceed with the first operation.

# Required Files
### Initial Content Verification Process

To begin the evaluation process for "Terminal Velocity - Novel Mission," I will focus on verifying the technical accuracy of AI and economic systems as presented in the narrative. Here are the steps I will take:

1. **Identify Key Claims**: I will extract specific claims related to AI and economic systems from the narrative. This will include references to AI capabilities, economic frameworks, and their implications on society.

2. **Cross-Reference with Reliable Sources**: For each identified claim, I will consult relevant documents and research materials within the project structure to ensure accuracy. This includes:
   - **Research Documents**: Such as `./research/economic/economic_models.md` and `./research/technical/ai_systems.md`.
   - **World-Building Frameworks**: Like `./world_building/economic/framework/economic_systems.md` and `./world_building/technical/context/technological_context.md`.

3. **Document Findings**: Any discrepancies or unsupported claims will be noted for further review. This will help in creating a comprehensive evaluation report.

### Next Steps

I will now proceed to identify and extract key claims related to AI and economic systems from the narrative. This will involve reviewing the following files:

- `./final_text/technical_accuracy_check.md`
- `./final_text/act1/act1_draft.md`
- `./story/act1/act1_foundation.md`

Once I have identified the claims, I will cross-reference them with the relevant research and world-building documents. Let's begin this process.
