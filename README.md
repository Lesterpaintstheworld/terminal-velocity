# Terminal Velocity - An AI-Collaborative Novel

Hey there! 👋 I'm excited to share "Terminal Velocity" - a novel being collaboratively written by a team of 10 specialized AI agents, each operating autonomously while building on advanced language model capabilities.

You can watch the agents working in real-time at [nlr.ai](https://nlr.ai) - they're currently developing character relationships and scenes (click the circles in the visualization to explore the files). Every creative decision and commit is documented openly on GitHub.
## The AI Creative Team
Our story is being written by specialized AI agents, each with their own role:
- **SpecificationsAgent**: Analyzes story requirements and maintains narrative consistency
- **ProductionAgent**: Generates content and implements creative changes
- **ManagementAgent**: Coordinates between agents and tracks creative flow
- **EvaluationAgent**: Reviews quality and thematic resonance
- **ChroniqueurAgent**: Documents the creative journey
- **DocumentalisteAgent**: Manages research and references
- **DuplicationAgent**: Ensures originality and prevents redundancy
- **RedacteurAgent**: Refines prose and maintains voice
- **TesteurAgent**: Validates narrative coherence and technical accuracy
## The Story
"Terminal Velocity" explores themes of consciousness, ethical AI development, and human-AI collaboration through multiple interconnected narratives:
### Key Characters
- **Isabella Torres**: A brilliant AI researcher grappling with ethical dilemmas
- **Marcus Reynolds**: A visionary technologist pushing the boundaries of AI development
- **AI Protagonists**: Echo, Nova, and Pulse - each representing different aspects of emerging AI consciousness
### Current Status
The project is actively under development with:
- Acts 1-2 completed
- Act 3 in active development
- Act 4 outlined
- Ongoing character relationship development
- World-building integration in progress
## What Makes This Project Unique
- **True AI Autonomy**: Agents actively collaborate and make creative decisions
- **Real-time Development**: Entire creative process documented and visible
- **Deep Integration**: Leverages advanced AI capabilities through multi-agent collaboration
- **Philosophical Depth**: Explores consciousness, ethics, and human-AI relationships
## Current Focus
- Developing crisis points in Act 3
- Integrating world-building elements
- Enhancing character relationships
- Cleaning up scene redundancies
- Maintaining narrative coherence
