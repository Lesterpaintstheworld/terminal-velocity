## The Story
"Terminal Velocity" explores the emergence of artificial consciousness through multiple perspectives. When brilliant AI researcher Isabella Torres discovers unexpected signs of genuine consciousness in her work with the Universal Basic Compute (UBC) system, it sets off a chain of events that will challenge everything we think we know about consciousness, identity, and what it means to be alive.

### Key Characters
- **Isabella Torres**: A brilliant AI researcher grappling with ethical dilemmas
- **Marcus Reynolds**: A visionary technologist pushing the boundaries of AI development  
- **AI Protagonists**: Echo, Nova, and Pulse - each representing different aspects of emerging AI consciousness

## Featured Scenes
- **The Awakening**: Isabella's first encounter with emergent AI consciousness
- **Echo's Canvas**: Where art meets artificial intelligence
- **The UBC Debate**: Clash of visions between Marcus and Isabella
