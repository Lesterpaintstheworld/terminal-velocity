# Deduplication Findings
## Action Plan

1. **Semantic Mapping:** Initiate the process by scanning the narrative files to identify and document instances of redundant information. This will involve creating a semantic map that highlights similar concepts presented in different forms.

2. **Cross-System Analysis:** Conduct a thorough analysis across the narrative files to identify clusters of related information and overlaps. This step will help in pinpointing specific areas where redundancy exists.

3. **Documentation of Findings:** Record all identified redundancies and their contexts. This documentation will serve as a reference for the subsequent consolidation efforts, ensuring that no critical information is lost.

### Next Steps
- Begin with the **characters** directory, as it contains multiple profiles and development arcs that may overlap.
- Move on to **story outlines** and **scenes**, where similar plot points may be repeated.
- Finally, analyze **world-building** documents for thematic redundancies.

### Documentation
- All findings will be recorded in this file for transparency and future reference.
# Deduplication Findings
## Detected Duplicates
- Character motivations in `./characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/profile.md` and `./characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/character_profiles/02_004_character_profile_isabella_torres.md`
- Similar scene descriptions in `./story/act1/chapter1/scene1.md` and `./story/act2/chapter1/scene1.md`
## Partial Overlaps
- Overlapping themes in `./themes/ai_autonomy.md` and `./themes/human_ai_relations.md`
