# Deduplication Findings
## Action Plan

1. **Identify Duplicate Content**:
   - **Scan Narrative Files**: Begin by analyzing the files listed in the project structure for semantically similar content and partial overlaps. Focus on sections that may have repetitive themes, phrases, or narrative arcs.
   - **Utilize Tools**: Employ text analysis tools to assist in detecting redundancy, especially in character profiles, scenes, and thematic discussions.

2. **Document Findings**:
   - **Create a Report**: Document specific files and sections that contain redundant content. This report should include:
     - File names and paths.
     - A brief description of the overlapping content.
     - Recommendations for consolidation.

3. **Prepare for Merging**:
   - **Develop a Consolidation Strategy**: Based on the findings, outline which files will be merged. Ensure that:
     - The context and meaning of each segment are preserved.
     - Any thematic elements are reinforced through the consolidation process.
   - **Validation Checks**: Before merging, perform checks to confirm that all relevant information is captured and that merging will not disrupt narrative integrity.

### Next Steps
- Begin with the **characters** directory, as it contains multiple profiles and development arcs that may overlap.
- Move on to **story outlines** and **scenes**, where similar plot points may be repeated.
- Finally, analyze **world-building** documents for thematic redundancies.

### Documentation
- All findings will be recorded in this file for transparency and future reference.
# Deduplication Findings
## Detected Duplicates
- Character motivations in `./characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/profile.md` and `./characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/character_profiles/02_004_character_profile_isabella_torres.md`
- Similar scene descriptions in `./story/act1/chapter1/scene1.md` and `./story/act2/chapter1/scene1.md`
## Partial Overlaps
- Overlapping themes in `./themes/ai_autonomy.md` and `./themes/human_ai_relations.md`
# Deduplication Findings
## Action Plan

1. **Semantic Mapping:** Initiate the process by scanning the narrative files to identify and document instances of redundant information. This will involve creating a semantic map that highlights similar concepts presented in different forms.

2. **Cross-System Analysis:** Conduct a thorough analysis across the narrative files to identify clusters of related information and overlaps. This step will help in pinpointing specific areas where redundancy exists.

3. **Documentation of Findings:** Record all identified redundancies and their contexts. This documentation will serve as a reference for the subsequent consolidation efforts, ensuring that no critical information is lost.

### Next Steps
- Begin with the **characters** directory, as it contains multiple profiles and development arcs that may overlap.
- Move on to **story outlines** and **scenes**, where similar plot points may be repeated.
- Finally, analyze **world-building** documents for thematic redundancies.

### Documentation
- All findings will be recorded in this file for transparency and future reference.
