# Deduplication Findings

## Objective
### Step 1: Initial Content Scan
- Conduct a comprehensive scan of all narrative files to identify content duplications. This involves analyzing the text for similar or identical passages that could be consolidated.

### Step 2: Document Findings
- Document the identified duplications and their contexts to prepare for the next phase of consolidation. This will ensure that we have a clear reference point for the content that needs to be merged.

### Step 3: Prepare for Consolidation
- Plan the safe consolidation strategy for the identified duplicates, ensuring that we have a method to preserve context and meaning during the merging process. This step will involve outlining how to approach the merging to maintain narrative coherence and technical accuracy.

These actions will set the groundwork for effective deduplication while ensuring that narrative integrity is maintained.

### Action Plan
1. **Conduct Initial Content Duplication Detection**: 
   - Scan through the narrative files to identify semantically similar content and partial overlaps. This will involve analyzing the text for repeated phrases and similar narrative arcs.
2. **Document Findings**: 
   - Create a report summarizing the identified duplicates, including their locations and the nature of the similarities. This will serve as a reference for the next steps in the consolidation process.
3. **Prepare for Safe Consolidation**: 
   - Develop a structured plan for merging the identified duplicate content, ensuring that all relevant information is captured and that the narrative integrity is maintained. This will include pre-consolidation checks to evaluate the potential impact on the narrative structure.

2. **Document Findings**:
   - **Create a Report**: Document specific files and sections that contain redundant content. This report should include:
     - File names and paths.
     - A brief description of the overlapping content.
     - Recommendations for consolidation.

3. **Prepare for Merging**:
   - **Develop a Consolidation Strategy**: Based on the findings, outline which files will be merged. Ensure that:
     - The context and meaning of each segment are preserved.
     - Any thematic elements are reinforced through the consolidation process.
   - **Validation Checks**: Before merging, perform checks to confirm that all relevant information is captured and that merging will not disrupt narrative integrity.

### Next Steps
- Begin with the **characters** directory, as it contains multiple profiles and development arcs that may overlap.
- Move on to **story outlines** and **scenes**, where similar plot points may be repeated.
- Finally, analyze **world-building** documents for thematic redundancies.

### Documentation
- All findings will be recorded in this file for transparency and future reference.
