## Objective
### Step 1: Content Duplication Detection
- **Action:** Scan all narrative files in the project directory to identify and document semantically similar content. This includes detecting partial overlaps and noting down all identified duplications for tracking purposes.

### Step 2: Safe Consolidation Strategy
- **Action:** Develop a strategy for merging the identified duplicate content while preserving the context and meaning. This will involve creating a plan for how to integrate the duplicates without losing critical information.

### Step 3: Pre-consolidation Checks
- **Action:** Conduct pre-consolidation checks to assess the potential impacts of merging the identified duplicates. This includes ensuring that all necessary information is captured and ready for consolidation. 

These steps will set the foundation for effective deduplication while ensuring narrative coherence and technical accuracy.

1. **Identify Key Files for Analysis:**
   - Focus on narrative files, character profiles, and world-building documents.
   - Prioritize files that are likely to contain overlapping content, such as:
     - Character profiles (e.g., `./characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/profile.md`)
     - Scene descriptions (e.g., `./story/act1/chapter1/scene1.md`)
     - Economic frameworks (e.g., `./research/economic/economic_framework.md`)

2. **Content Comparison:**
   - Use text analysis tools to compare the content of the identified files.
   - Look for:
     - Similar phrases or sentences.
     - Repeated themes or concepts.
     - Overlapping character arcs or development.

3. **Document Findings:**
   - Create a report detailing:
     - The files compared.
     - Specific sections or sentences that are duplicated.
     - The nature of the duplication (exact match, paraphrase, etc.).

2. **Document Identified Duplications**: Create a record of the identified duplications, ensuring that all instances are logged for tracking purposes. This documentation will be essential for the next steps in the consolidation process.

3. **Prepare for Safe Consolidation**: Conduct a pre-consolidation check to assess the readiness for merging the identified duplicate content. This includes ensuring that all necessary information is captured and validating that the context and meaning will be preserved during the consolidation.

### Summary of Proposed Actions
- Identify and document duplicate content across narrative files.
- Log the identified duplications for future reference.
- Prepare for the consolidation process by conducting necessary checks.

These steps will set the foundation for effective content integration while maintaining narrative coherence and technical integrity.

# Required Files
To achieve the objectives outlined in your action plan, I will proceed with the following steps:

### 1. Content Duplication Detection
- **Scan Narrative Files**: I will analyze the project structure to identify potential duplicate content across the various narrative files, particularly focusing on sections that may have overlapping themes, character arcs, or dialogue.

### 2. Document Identified Duplications
- **Log Duplicates**: As duplicates are identified, I will create a detailed record of these instances, noting the specific files and sections where the duplications occur. This documentation will facilitate the consolidation process.

### 3. Prepare for Safe Consolidation
- **Pre-Consolidation Checks**: Before merging any content, I will ensure that all necessary information is captured and that the context and meaning of the content will be preserved. This includes validating that the identified duplicates serve the same narrative purpose.

### Summary of Proposed Actions
- **Identify and Document**: I will systematically identify and document duplicate content across narrative files.
- **Log for Reference**: All identified duplications will be logged for future reference.
- **Conduct Checks**: Necessary checks will be conducted to prepare for the consolidation process.

### Next Steps
1. **Initiate Content Analysis**: Begin scanning the files listed in the project structure for semantic similarities.
2. **Create a Duplication Report**: Document findings in a structured format for easy reference.
3. **Validate Readiness for Consolidation**: Ensure all identified duplicates are ready for merging without losing narrative coherence.

This structured approach will ensure that the narrative remains engaging and coherent while maintaining the technical integrity of the content.
