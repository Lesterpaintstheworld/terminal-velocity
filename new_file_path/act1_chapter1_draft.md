# Act 1, Chapter 1 Draft: The UBC Presentation

*Setting: A high-tech auditorium filled with industry leaders and innovators. The atmosphere buzzes with anticipation.*

Isabella Torres stood at the edge of the stage, her heart racing as she watched Dr. Evelyn Carter prepare to present the Universal Basic Compute (UBC) framework. The audience, a mix of corporate executives and tech enthusiasts, was eager to hear about the latest advancements in AI technology.

Dr. Carter began, her voice steady and confident. "Today, we unveil the Universal Basic Compute system, a revolutionary framework designed to ensure equitable access to AI resources. This system promises to reshape our economic landscape, providing opportunities for all."

As the presentation continued, Isabella felt a mix of excitement and apprehension. She knew that while UBC had the potential to transform society, it also raised significant ethical questions. Would AI truly benefit everyone, or would it deepen existing inequalities?

**Dialogue:**
- **Evelyn:** "Imagine a world where AI not only enhances our productivity but also ensures equitable distribution of resources. The UBC framework is designed to make this vision a reality."
- **Isabella (internal thought):** "But at what cost? We must ensure that the rights of AI are recognized, or we risk repeating the mistakes of the past."

As the presentation concluded, Isabella's mind raced with possibilities and concerns. She knew she had to act quickly to advocate for ethical AI practices before the momentum shifted entirely towards profit-driven motives.
