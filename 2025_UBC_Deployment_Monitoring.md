# Monitoring Operation for UBC Deployment in 2025

### Monitoring Setup
To effectively document the deployment of the UBC system, the following files will be monitored for significant changes:
- `./characters/human_characters/*.md`
- `./characters/ai_protagonists/*.md`
- `./world_building/economic/framework/*.md`
- `./story/act1/*.md`
- `./chronicles/ubc_initial_deployment.md`
- `./2025_UBC_Deployment_Documentation.md`
- `./characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/interaction_scripts.md`
- `./characters/human_characters/marcus_reynolds/interaction_scripts.md`
- `./characters/human_characters/sarah_chen/interaction_scripts.md`
- `./chronicles/ubc_initial_deployment.md`
- `./2025_UBC_Deployment_Documentation.md`
- `./characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/interaction_scripts.md`
- `./characters/human_characters/marcus_reynolds/interaction_scripts.md`
- `./characters/human_characters/sarah_chen/interaction_scripts.md`

1. **Monitor File Changes:** Set up monitoring on relevant files to track changes indicating significant developments in the UBC system or its economic impact.

2. **Document Initial Deployment:** Create a detailed chronicle of the initial deployment of the UBC system in 2025, capturing context, key events, and interactions between humans and AI.

3. **Establish Narrative Structure:** Create a structured template for documenting narratives, ensuring coherence and alignment with the mission's thematic elements.
