# Monitoring Operation for UBC Deployment in 2025

### Monitoring Setup
To effectively document the deployment of the UBC system, the following files will be monitored for significant changes:
- `./2025_UBC_Deployment_Documentation.md`
- `./chronicles/ubc_initial_deployment.md`
- `./characters/human_characters/*.md`
- `./characters/ai_protagonists/*.md`
- `./world_building/economic/framework/*.md`
- `./story/act1/*.md`
- `./change_logs.md`

### Objective
1. **Monitor File Changes:** Set up monitoring of designated project files to capture significant developments related to the Universal Basic Compute (UBC) system and its impact on AI autonomy and economic transformations.
2. **Identify Key Events:** Analyze the captured file changes to identify key events that reflect the evolution of AI and economic shifts, focusing on human and AI interactions, conflicts, and resolutions.
3. **Document Findings:** Create structured chronicles based on the identified key events, ensuring clarity and coherence while aligning with the mission's themes of economic autonomy and human-AI relationships.
