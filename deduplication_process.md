# Deduplication Process for Terminal Velocity Project

## Objective
To streamline the narrative by identifying and merging duplicate content while maintaining the integrity of the story.

## Deduplication Process Steps

1. **Content Duplication Detection**: Initiate the process by scanning the narrative files to identify semantically similar content. This will involve analyzing the text for thematic relevance and contextual overlap to pinpoint potential duplicates.

2. **Detecting Partial Overlaps**: Conduct a second analysis focusing on the file structures for partial duplications. This will include searching for repeated phrases or similar narrative arcs that may require consolidation.

3. **Pre-Consolidation Checks**: Before proceeding with any merges, perform checks to assess the potential impacts on narrative structure. This will ensure that the consolidation does not disrupt other narrative threads and that all relevant information is captured.
