# Content Integration Overview for Terminal Velocity

## 1. Scan System Files
I will identify and document valuable content from various sections of the narrative, focusing on the following areas:

- **Character Development**: Files related to character profiles, development arcs, and interactions.
- **World Building**: Files that detail the societal, economic, and technological contexts.
- **Story Structure**: Files that outline acts, chapters, and scenes.
- **Research and Insights**: Files that contain economic models and AI-related research.

## 2. Assess Integration Opportunities
After gathering content, I will evaluate the insights for integration based on their relevance to the narrative. Key considerations will include:

- **Thematic Relevance**: How well the content aligns with the central themes of the narrative.
- **Character Arcs**: Opportunities to enhance character development through integrated insights.
- **Plot Progression**: Identifying gaps or overlaps in the story structure that can be addressed through integration.

## 3. Document Findings
I will create a structured document that outlines:

- **Identified Content**: A summary of valuable content extracted from the files.
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Areas where additional information or clarity is needed.
- **Potential Integration Points**: Suggestions for how and where to integrate insights into the narrative.

## Next Steps
