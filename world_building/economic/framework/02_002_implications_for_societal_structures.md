## Economic Implications of AI Rights
The recognition of AI rights within the UBC framework significantly influences economic governance and resource allocation. When AI entities are granted rights, they can autonomously manage resources, leading to more equitable distribution and enhanced efficiency. This shift is exemplified by AI-driven marketplaces that empower small businesses by providing access to computational resources, resulting in increased competitiveness and innovation within local economies.
